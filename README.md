# My Awesome iOS App
A simple iOS demo app based on the tutorial in the blog post ["How to integrate our document scanning functionalities"](https://scanbot.io/blog/ios-development-tutorial-how-to-integrate-our-document-scanning-functionalities).

For a **full** example project which demonstrates **all** API features of the Scanbot SDK see the repo https://github.com/doo/scanbot-sdk-example-ios.
